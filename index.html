                works of literature ever written, and Tolstoy himself called it
                his first true novel. It was initially released in serial

                A complex novel in eight parts, with more than a dozen major

                (depending on the translation and publisher), typically
                contained in two volumes. It deals with themes of betrayal,
                faith, family, marriage, Imperial Russian society, desire, and
                rural vs. city life. The story centers on an extramarital affair

                Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalizes the social circles of Saint

              <p class="card-text">
                The Idiot is a novel by the 19th-century Russian author Fyodor
                Dostoevsky. It was first published serially in the journal The
                Russian Messenger in 1868–69. The title is an ironic reference
                to the central character of the novel, Prince Lev Nikolayevich
                Myshkin, a young man whose goodness, open-hearted simplicity and
                guilelessness lead many of the more worldly characters he
                encounters to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence and
                insight. In the character of Prince Myshkin, Dostoevsky set
                himself the task of depicting "the positively good and beautiful
                man." The novel examines the consequences of placing such a
                singular individual at the centre of the conflicts, desires,
                passions and egoism of worldly society, both for the man himself
                and for those with whom he becomes involved.

                Demons is a novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky, first published in the
                journal The Russian Messenger in 1871–72. It is considered one
                of the four masterworks written by Dostoevsky after his return
                from Siberian exile, along with Crime and Punishment (1866), The
                Idiot (1869) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). Demons is a
                social and political satire, a psychological drama, and
                large-scale tragedy. Joyce Carol Oates has described it as
                "Dostoevsky's most confused and violent novel, and his most
                satisfactorily 'tragic' work." According to Ronald Hingley, it
                is Dostoevsky's "greatest onslaught on Nihilism", and "one of
                humanity's most impressive achievements—perhaps even its supreme
                achievement—in the art of prose fiction." Demons is an allegory
                of the potentially catastrophic consequences of the political
                and moral nihilism that were becoming prevalent in Russia in the
                1860s.

                Crime and Punishment is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor
                Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The
                Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It
                was later published in a single volume. It is the second of
                Dostoevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten
                years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered
                the first great novel of his "mature" period of writing. The
                novel is often cited as one of the supreme achievements in
                literature.

                The Master and Margarita is a novel by Russian writer Mikhail
                Bulgakov, written in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940
                during Stalin's regime. A censored version was published in
                Moscow magazine in 1966–1967, after the writer's death. The
                manuscript was not published as a book until 1967, in Paris. A
                samizdat version circulated that included parts cut out by
                official censors, and these were incorporated in a 1969 version
                published in Frankfurt. The novel has since been published in
                several languages and editions. The story concerns a visit by
                the devil to the officially atheistic Soviet Union. The Master
                and Margarita combines supernatural elements with satirical dark
                comedy and Christian philosophy, defying categorization within a
                single genre. Many critics consider it to be one of the best
                novels of the 20th century, as well as the foremost of Soviet
                satires

                The White Guard is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov, first published
                in 1925 in literary journal Rossiya. It was not reprinted in the
                Soviet Union until 1966. The White Guard first appeared in
                serial form in the Soviet-era literary journal Rossiya in 1925,
                but the magazine was closed down before the serial was
                completed. The complete book was published in Paris in 1927. The
                censored version was published in the Soviet Union in 1966. The
                complete version was published only in 1989. After the first two
                parts of The White Guard were published in Rossiya, Bulgakov was
                invited to write a version for the stage. He called the play The
                Days of the Turbins. This was produced at the Moscow Art
                Theatre, to great acclaim. According to some sources, Stalin saw
                it no fewer than 20 times. In fact, the play completely
                overshadowed the book, which was in any event virtually
                unobtainable in any form.
